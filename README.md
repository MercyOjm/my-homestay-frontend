## WAY OF WORKING

* Define the list of features eg.login,user registration,search functionality,property listing
* Prepare figma slides for each feature.
* Breakdown features into stories. Stories should not be bigger than 3-4 days.
* there should be one story each for frontend,backend,database.
* Everybody should work on frontend,backend & database stories in rotation.
* We should plan for two weeks sprint which means 10 days of work for each developer.
* one of us will be the scrum master for each sprint with the half capacity which means we will have total capacity of 35 days for one sprint
* We should not take more than 35 story point in one sprint.
* One point corresponds to 1 day
* It will be scrum master responsibility to keep the stories ready for next sprint in the backlog.
* every repository will have main branch and each developer will create a feature branch from main branch to work on the story.
* each developer will create pull request for each story.
* pull request must be approved by another developer before merging to the main branch.
* we can think branch name based on story e.g. feature-story-001
* We can give demo of sprint to Fahim at the end of sprint.
